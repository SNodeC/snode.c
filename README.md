This project implements the cookies in a similiar way to the Express framework 
To make it work I implemented a function that can receive up to 7 options (in string format) and then with a function setOptions
the options are parsed into a single string, which later will be concatenated with the value of the cookie (separated with ;)

For running the program the path in app.serverRoot() should be changed according to the local directory where the html is stored
